# Math

## Scalar

A scalar is a quantity like distance/mass/speed etc.

To represent it, a single number is used.

## Vector

A vector is a quantity that holds informations regarding a direction (in any space), plus a scalar (magnitude).

To represent it, we use as many scalars as the dimensions of the space it belongs to:

$$
R^2 \rightarrow \vec{v} = \lbrace v_1, v_2 \rbrace
$$

$$
R^3 \rightarrow \vec{v} = \lbrace v_1, v_2, v_3 \rbrace
$$

$$
R^n \rightarrow \vec{v} = \lbrace v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \rbrace
$$
